The Undergraduate Poker Club strives to be a hub for the poker community at Carnegie Mellon University to meet, learn, and play.

We aim to engage all manner of poker players with a wide array of events that include everything from charity tournaments and interactive workshops to guest speakers and networking opportunities.

Outside of CMU, we seek to build lasting connections with trading firms and other companies that are interested in students with the strategic and analytical skills developed through poker.
